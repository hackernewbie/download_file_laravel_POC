A very basic POC to show hoe multiple file upload and file download works in Laravel. 

This sample project is written in Laravel 8.

Just clone it, create your database,, add database to your .env file, run *composer install*, run *php artisanmigrate* and the app should be up and running in no time.

Cheers,
